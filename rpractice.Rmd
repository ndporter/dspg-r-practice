## Intro to markdown

Markdown allows you to do things like **bold**, *italic*, `code font`
and more!

Make a list with asterisks like:

-   \* bold with double-asterisk

-   \* italics with underscores

-   \* code-type fond with backticks

-   You can also use hyphens instead of asterisks.

For a numbere list:

1.  1\. bold.....

2.  1\. italic....

3.  1\. code.....

Hyperlinks are like [Hyperlinked text](https://mylink.org)


Load gapminder data in along with plotting package.

```{r load_data}
#This line will not run
library(gapminder) #this chunk of a line will not run
library(ggplot2)
gap <- gapminder
```

Try and fail to plot the data.

```{r make_plot}
plot(lifeExp ~ year, data=gap)
```

```{r}
temp <- c(1,2,3) 
```
